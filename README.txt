 OneMansRubbish relates to the old saying "One man's rubbish is another man's treasure"
 
 The primary goal of the "OneMansRubbish" website is to provide a platform for users to easily share
 and claim unwanted items for re-use. 
 The website facilitates a community-driven approach to reduce waste and promote sustainability by connecting 
 individuals looking to dispose of items with those who can repurpose them.

 Users can post unwanted items on the site for collection.
 Users can also claim an item if the want to take it off the posters hands.
 There is a comment section to ask questions on a specific item.

 The profile section shows user details, your posts, people who have claimed them and items you may have claimed, from here you can directly message 
 the users to arrange collection without having to organise it through the comment section where it is visable to all.
 within the profile section users can edit posts and change status of posts to "gone" once item has been collected. 
 This will auto archive the post from the main page.
